	abstract = {A configuration selection method for CI calculations is discussed and applied in which the energy lowering produced in a secular equation by the addition of a given test species to a series of dominant configurations is used as an ordering parameter. Configurations with energy lowerings below a given energy cut-off value are not included in the final secular equations but instead a method of estimating the combined effect of the neglected species on the corresponding non-selected CI results is developed. The influence of the choice of main configurations used in the selection process is given close examination as well as the importance of the MO basis employed in the treatment as a whole; in the latter case a non-iterative procedure for obtaining approximate natural orbitals for such calculations is suggested. The resulting configuration selection procedure is equally applicable to all types of electronic states in any nuclear geometry and the results of the associated CI calculations are seen to be essentially equivalent to a complete treatment in which all single- and double-excitation species with respect to aseries of dominant configurations in a given state are included.},

	abstract = {We present an extended implementation of the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method combined with the quantum-chemical density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). In the previous study, we introduced the combined theory, referred to as DMRG-MRCI, as a method to calculate high-level dynamic electron correlation on top of the DMRG wave function that accounts for active-space (or strong) correlation using a large number of active orbitals. The DMRG-MRCI method is built on the full internal-contraction scheme for the compact reference treatment and on the cumulant approximation for the treatment of the four-particle rank reduced density matrix (4-RDM). The previous implementation achieved the MRCI calculations with the active space (24e,24o), which are deemed the record largest, whereas the inherent Nact8 ? N complexity of computation was found a hindrance to using further large active space. In this study, an extended optimization of the tensor contractions is developed by explicitly incorporating the rank reduction of the decomposed form of the cumulant-approximated 4-RDM into the factorization. It reduces the computational scaling (to Nact7 ? N) as well as the cache-miss penalty associated with direct evaluation of complex cumulant reconstruction. The present scheme, however, faces the increased complexity of factorization patterns for optimally implementing the tensor contraction terms involving the decomposed 4-RDM objects. We address this complexity using the enhanced symbolic manipulation computer program for deriving and coding programmable equations. The new DMRG-MRCI implementation is applied to the determination of the stability of the iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin relative to the iron(V) electronic isomer (electromer) using the active space (29e,29o) (including four second d-shell orbitals of iron) with triple-?-quality atomic orbital basis sets. The DMRG-cu(4)-MRCI+Q model is shown to favor the triradicaloid iron(IV)-oxo state as the lowest energy state and characterize the iron(V) electromer as thermally inaccessible, supporting the earlier experimental and density functional studies. This conflicts with the previous MR calculations using the restricted active-space second-order perturbation theory (RASPT2) with the similar-size active space (29e,28o) reported by Pierloot et al. (Rado?, M.; Broclawik, E.; Pierloot, K. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2011, 7, 898), showing that the hypothetical iron(V) state indicated by recent laser flash photolysis (LFP) studies is likely thermally accessible because of its underestimated relative energy.},

The DMRG-SCF approach, similarly to CASSCF, properly describes the multiconfigurational character of the wave function but avoids the exponential scaling of the FCI method and replaces it with a polynomial scaling. Hence, calculations for a larger number of orbitals and electrons in the active space are possible since the DMRG method provides an efficient tool to automatically select from the full Hilbert space the many-body contracted basis states that are the most important for the description of the wave function.},

The computational cost of producing the two-body density matrix is proportional to O ( M 3 k 2 + M 2 k 4 ) . The method is based on the assumption that different elements of the two-body density matrix can be calculated during different steps of a sweep. Hence, it is desirable that the wave function at the convergence does not change during a sweep. We discuss the theoretical structure of the wave function ansatz used in DMRG, concluding that during the one-site DMRG procedure, the energy and the wave function are converging monotonically at every step of the sweep. Thus, the one-site algorithm provides an opportunity to obtain the two-body density matrix free from the N -representability problem. We explain the problem of local minima that may be encountered in the DMRG calculations. We discuss theoretically why and when the one- and two-site DMRG procedures may get stuck in a metastable solution, and we list practical solutions helping the minimization to avoid the local minima.},

The new approach is tested on HNCO, a model system, that has a singlet-triplet curve crossing between states of the same symmetry. The advantages of the spin-adapted DMRG scheme are discussed, and it is concluded that the spin-adapted DMRG method converges better in almost all cases and gives more parallel curves to the full configuration interaction result than the non-spin-adapted method. It is shown that the spin-adapted DMRG energies can be lower than the ones obtained from the non-spin-adapted scheme. Such a counterintuitive result is explained by noting that the spin-adapted method is not a special case of the non-spin-adapted one; consequently, the spin-adapted result is not an upper bound for the non-spin-adapted energy.},

For the lattice energy of the prototypical benzene crystal, we combined the quantum chemical advances of the last decade to attain sub-kilojoule per mole accuracy, an order-of-magnitude improvement in certainty over prior calculations that necessitates revision of the experimental extrapolation to 0 kelvin. Our computations reveal the nature of binding by improving on previously inaccessible or inaccurate multibody and many-electron contributions and provide revised estimates of the effects of temperature, vibrations, and relaxation. Our demonstration raises prospects for definitive first-principles resolution of competing polymorphs in molecular crystal structure prediction.
Working out how to pack benzene in silico
Many organic compounds crystallize in several different energetically similar packing arrangements, or polymorphs. This complicates processes such as drug formulation that rely on reproducible crystallization. Yang et al. have now achieved the long-standing goal of calculating a crystal packing arrangement from first principles to an accuracy that can distinguish polymorphs (see the Perspective by Price). They used benzene as a prototypical test case and applied quantum chemical methods that improve estimates of multibody interactions. The results bode well for future applications of theory to optimization of crystallization protocols.

Our calculations reveal the presence of two minima in the electronic energy curve along the Cu?OL bond, separated by only 6 kcal/mol, and corresponding to the X-ray structures of the CuO6 centers in Cu(hfac)2LPr at 115 and 293 K, respectively. The two energetic minima are characterized by a different electronic structure, thus giving rise to a different three-spin exchange coupling and explaining the thermally induced spin transitions in this family of compounds. The concomitant variations in the magnetic properties, i.e. g factors and magnetic moments ?eff(T) were calculated and compared with the experimental data of Cu(hfac)2LPr. Even if the correspondence is only qualitative, our calculations provide a convincing explanation of the observed magnetic peculiarities. In particular, at low temperatures, the predicted ground-state is 2Au, well separated from the 2Ag, 4Au states and therefore exclusively populated. Its calculated g factors, g? = 1.848, g? = 1.965, 1.974, qualitatively correspond to the observed g {\textless} 2 signals in the low-temperature EPR spectra. The previously assumed formal spin assignment {\textgreater}N?O??Cu??O?N{\textless} for these linear spin triads is challenged by our calculations, pointing instead to a more important role of the end-standing NO in the exchange interactions with Cu(II).},

	abstract = {EPR spectroscopy has proven to be an indispensable tool in elucidating the structure of metal sites in proteins. In recent years, experimental EPR data have been complemented by theoretical calculations, which have become a standard tool of many quantum chemical packages. However, there have only been a few attempts to calculate EPR g tensors for exchange-coupled systems with more than two spins. In this work, we present a quantum chemical study of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of intermediates in the reaction cycle of multicopper oxidases and of their inorganic models. All these systems contain three copper(II) ions bridged by hydroxide or O2? anions and their ground states are antiferromagnetically coupled doublets. We demonstrate that only multireference methods, such as CASSCF/CASPT2 or MRCI can yield qualitatively correct results (compared to the experimental values) and consider the accuracy of the calculated EPR g tensors as the current benchmark of quantum chemical methods. By decomposing the calculated g tensors into terms arising from interactions of the ground state with the various excited states, the origin of the zero-field splitting is explained. The results of the study demonstrate that a truly quantitative prediction of the g tensors of exchange-coupled systems is a great challenge to contemporary theory. The predictions strongly depend on small energy differences that are difficult to predict with sufficient accuracy by any quantum chemical method that is applicable to systems of the size of our target systems.},

Our results highlight the limitations of long-standing models of their electronic structure. In particular, we demonstrate that the widely used Heisenberg double exchange model underestimates the number of states by one to two orders of magnitude, which can conclusively be traced to the absence of Fe d d excitations, thought to be important in these clusters. Furthermore, the electronic energy levels of even the same spin are dense on the scale of vibrational fluctuations and this provides a natural explanation for the ubiquity of these clusters in catalysis in nature.},

Lett.57, 852 (2002)]10.1209/epl/i2002-00393-0 to quantum chemical Hamiltonians. This involves using a quasi-density matrix, to ensure that the renormalized DMRG states are eigenfunctions of S ̂ 2 , and the Wigner-Eckart theorem, to reduce overall storage and computational costs. We argue that the spin-adapted DMRG algorithm is most advantageous for low spin states. Consequently, we also implement a singlet-embedding strategy due to Tatsuaki [Phys. Rev. E61, 3199 (2000)]10.1103/PhysRevE.61.3199 where we target high spin states as a component of a larger fictitious singlet system. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm to calculate one- and two-body reduced density matrices from the spin-adapted wavefunctions. We evaluate our developments with benchmark calculations on transition metal system active space models. These include the Fe2S2, [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, and Cr2 systems. In the case of Fe2S2, the spin-ladder spacing is on the microHartree scale, and here we show that we can target such very closely spaced states. In [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, we calculate particle and spin correlation functions, to examine the role of sulfur bridging orbitals in the electronic structure. In Cr2 we demonstrate that spin-adaptation with the Wigner-Eckart theorem and using singlet embedding can yield up to an order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. Overall, these calculations demonstrate the potential of using spin-adaptation to extend the range of DMRG calculations in complex transition metal problems.},

The MPS-LCC theory shows a speed up of several orders of magnitude over the usual Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm while delivering energies in excellent agreement with converged DMRG calculations. Also, in all the benchmark calculations presented here, MPS-LCC outperformed the commonly used multi-reference quantum chemistry methods in some cases giving energies in excess of an order of magnitude more accurate. As a size-extensive method that can treat large active spaces, MPS-LCC opens up the use of multireference quantum chemical techniques in strongly correlated ab initio Hamiltonians, including two- and three-dimensional solids.},

	abstract = {We propose a multireference linearized coupled cluster theory using matrix product states (MPSs-LCC) which provides remarkably accurate ground-state energies, at a computational cost that has the same scaling as multireference configuration interaction singles and doubles, for a wide variety of electronic Hamiltonians. These range from first-row dimers at equilibrium and stretched geometries to highly multireference systems such as the chromium dimer and lattice models such as periodic two-dimensional 1-band and 3-band Hubbard models. The MPS-LCC theory shows a speed up of several orders of magnitude over the usual Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm while delivering energies in excellent agreement with converged DMRG calculations. Also, in all the benchmark calculations presented here, MPS-LCC outperformed the commonly used multi-reference quantum chemistry methods in some cases giving energies in excess of an order of magnitude more accurate. As a size-extensive method that can treat large active spaces, MPS-LCC opens up the use of multireference quantum chemical techniques in strongly correlated ab initio Hamiltonians, including two- and three-dimensional solids.},

These cells have also been widely used for bioremediation of chlorinated solvents, and help sustain diverse microbial communities as well as higher organisms through the conversion of CH4 to complex organic compounds (e.g. in deep ocean and subterranean environments with substantial CH4 fluxes). It has been well-known for over 30 years that copper (Cu) plays a key role in the physiology and activity of methanotrophs, but it is only recently that we have begun to understand how these cells collect Cu, the role Cu plays in CH4 oxidation by the particulate CH4 monooxygenase, the effect of Cu on the proteome, and how Cu affects the ability of methanotrophs to oxidize different substrates. Here we summarize the current state of knowledge of the phylogeny, environmental distribution, and potential applications of methanotrophs for regional and global issues, as well as the role of Cu in regulating gene expression and proteome in these cells, its effects on enzymatic and whole-cell activity, and the novel Cu uptake system used by methanotrophs.},

In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

Its applications to the calculation of static, dynamic, and thermodynamic quantities in these systems are reviewed here. The potential of DMRG applications in the fields of two-dimensional quantum systems, quantum chemistry, three-dimensional small grains, nuclear physics, equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics, and time-dependent phenomena is also discussed.

	abstract = {Mitochondria contain their own genetic system and undergo a unique mode of cytoplasmic inheritance. Each organelle has multiple copies of a covalently closed circular DNA genome (mtDNA). The entire protein coding capacity of mtDNA is devoted to the synthesis of 13 essential subunits of the inner membrane complexes of the respiratory apparatus. Thus the majority of respiratory proteins and all of the other gene products necessary for the myriad mitochondrial functions are derived from nuclear genes. Transcription of mtDNA requires a small number of nucleus-encoded proteins including a single RNA polymerase (POLRMT), auxiliary factors necessary for promoter recognition (TFB1M, TFB2M) and activation (Tfam), and a termination factor (mTERF). This relatively simple system can account for the bidirectional transcription of mtDNA from divergent promoters and key termination events controlling the rRNA/mRNA ratio. Nucleomitochondrial interactions depend on the interplay between transcription factors (NRF-1, NRF-2, PPARα, ERRα, Sp1, and others) and members of the PGC-1 family of regulated coactivators (PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and PRC). The transcription factors target genes that specify the respiratory chain, the mitochondrial transcription, translation and replication machinery, and protein import and assembly apparatus among others. These factors are in turn activated directly or indirectly by PGC-1 family coactivators whose differential expression is controlled by an array of environmental signals including temperature, energy deprivation, and availability of nutrients and growth factors. These transcriptional paradigms provide a basic framework for understanding the integration of mitochondrial biogenesis and function with signaling events that dictate cell- and tissue-specific energetic properties.},

This approach is benchmarked against available experimental measurements and the complete active space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2), which is nowadays established as one of the most accurate theoretical models available. Dissociation energies, vibrational frequencies, and bond distances are computed at the RASPT2 level using several reference spaces. The major advantage of the RASPT2 method is that with a limited number of configuration state functions, it can reproduce well the equilibrium bond length and the vibrational frequency of the Cr dimer. On the other hand, the PES is well described only at short distances, while at large distances, it compares very poorly with the CASPT2. The dissociation energy is also ill-behaved, but its value can be largely improved using a simple workaround that we explain in the text. In the paper, we also address the effect of the Ionization Potential Electron Affinity (IPEA) shift (a parameter introduced in the zeroth-order Hamiltonian in the CASPT2 method to include the effect of two-electron terms) and show how its default value of 0.25 is not suitable for a proper description of the PES and of the spectroscopic parameters and must be changed to a more sound value of 0.45.},

No external criteria are used to define a p r i o r ibonds, lone pairs, and core orbitals. It is shown that the method similarly to Edmiston–Ruedenberg’s localization prefers the well established chemical concept of σ–π separation, while on the other hand, works as economically as Boys’ procedure. For the application of the new localization algorithm, no additional quantities are to be calculated, the knowledge of atomic overlap intergrals is sufficient. This feature allows a unique formulation of the theory, adaptable for both a b i n i t i o and semiempirical methods, even in those cases where the exact form of the atomic basis functions is not defined (like in the EHT and PPP calculations). The implementation of the procedure in already existing program systems is particularly easy. For illustrative examples, we compare the Edmiston–Ruedenberg and Boys localized orbitals with those calculated by the method suggested here, within both the CNDO/2 and a b i n i t i o frameworks (using STO‐3G and 6‐31G** basis sets) for several molecules (CO, H2CO, B2H6, and N2O4).

It was in the early twentieth century that Otto Warburg first described differences in the mitochondria of tumor vs. normal cells. He observed that tumor cells had an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis compared with normal cells. He hypothesized that this increase was due to the impairment in the respiratory capacity of tumor cells (Warburg1930,1956). This was the first of several notable differences observed between the mitochondria of normal and transformed cells that were subsequently discovered (reviewed in Weinhouse1955; Pedersen1978; Carafoli1980; Modica-Napolitano and Singh2002,2004; Modica-Napolitano et al.2007).

	abstract = {A family of heterospin polymer chain complexes Cu(hfac)2 with pyrazole-substituted nitronyl nitroxides (LR, where R = Me, Et, Pr) of the composition Cu(hfac)2LR was found. In the solid state the complexes undergo low-temperature structural rearrangements accompanied by magnetic effects analogous to spin-crossover. Polymer chains with a “head-to-head” or “head-to-tail” motif in Cu(hfac)2LR are formed as a result of the bridging coordination of LR through the imine N atom of pyrazole and one of the O atoms of the nitronyl nitroxide fragment. Despite the low-temperature structural phase transition, the single crystals retain the quality needed for an X-ray investigation, due to which the compounds may be studied at different temperatures and structural dynamics studies are possible. It was found that the major structural changes mainly occur in the coordination polyhedra, leading to phenomena analogous to spin-crossover. This rearrangement is possible due to the Jahn–Teller nature of the Cu(II) ion, which is responsible for the pulled octahedron structure of the coordination unit. The transition of the coordinated nitroxyl O atoms from the axial (d Cu–O ∼ 2.2-2.4 Å) to equatorial (d Cu–O ∼ 2.0 Å) position is accompanied by a transition of the exchange interaction in the Cu(II)–O•–N{\textless} exchange clusters from weak ferromagnetic (or weak antiferromagnetic) to strong anti-ferromagnetic, compensating the spins of the Cu(II) ion and the nitroxyl fragment. The motif of the polymer chain (“head-to-head” or “head-to-tail”) proved to be inessential to the occurrence of thermally induced spin transitions. In both cases, the shortening of the Cu–O distance in the Cu(II)–O•–N{\textless} exchange cluster decreases the effective magnetic moment of the complex by a factor of 2‾‾√{\textbackslash}sqrt 2 , because spin compensation occurs in only half of all coordination units (Cu(hfac)2LPr, Cu(hfac)2LMe, and Cu2(hfac)4LMeLEt). The low-temperature structural rearrangement in Cu(hfac)2LEt is unusual; it leads to longer Cu–O distances in the Cu(II)–O•–N{\textless} exchange cluster and to an abrupt transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic exchange. At reduced temperatures, the unit cell volume decreased by 5-6\% in all of the compounds. The cell parameters are large and so is the absolute value of the decrease (up to 400 Å3). The maximal decrease in the cell dimensions was observed in the directions of the chains and in the directions of the maximal shortening of the Cu...Cu distances. Minimal compression or even extension of the cell took place in the direction of lengthening of the Cu–Ohfac distances. The single crystals of Cu(hfac)2LEt and Cu(hfac)2LPr possess high mechanical stability in repeated cooling-heating cycles.},

What are the largest systems that can be treated at practical cost? What sort of accuracies can be obtained, and how do we reason about the computational difficulty in different molecules? By examining a diverse benchmark set of molecules: π-electron systems, benchmark main-group and transition metal dimers, and the Mn-oxo-salen and Fe-porphine organometallic compounds, we provide some answers to these questions, and show how the density matrix renormalization group is used in practice.},

	abstract = {Starting with spin polarized determinants for an antiferromagnetic transition metal dimer and spin projected states obtained from them, we show that both superexchange coupling and ligand spin polarization contribute to the Heisenberg coupling constant J describing a ladder of spin states. A single broken symmetry UHF calculation when combined with an independent calculation for the high-spin state yields J from the equation, E(Smax) − EB = − S2maxJ. Ligand spin polarization affects the average value of both spin-independent one-electron operators like the electron density at the metal site and spin-dependent operators such as A tensors at metal and ligand sites. The theoretical analysis here shows a number of new physical effects and generalizes the results of our previous paper which dealt solely with the effects of superexchange coupling. The limitations of this approach are also examined. A more comprehensive theory is readily formulated for computational purposes, but closed form equations as a function of S are very complicated. In general, the spin hamiltonian is not of Heisenberg form when all ligand spin polarization terms are included. However, the major ligand spin polarization terms and the superexchange terms are of Heisenberg form. Both of these are included in the broken symmetry approach.},

We summarize the uses of broken symmetry density functional calculations and spin projection methods for extracting Heisenberg spin coupling and electron delocalization parameters, as well as for understanding charge distributions and orbital aspects of electronic structure. The value of spin projection coefficients for sorting out spin coupling patterns in complex systems is also emphasized. Among the systems examined are oxidized, high-potential, iron-sulfur proteins, 4Fe ferredoxin proteins and related synthetic complexes. By analysis of experimental hyperfine parameters, a detailed model of spin coupling for the “double cubane” P cluster of nitrogenase has been proposed in recent work based on Mössbauer, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray structural data; there is one pairwise valence delocalized and one trapped valence cubane in the P (oxidized) state. In the area of electron transfer energetics, we have found that Heisenberg spin coupling and electron delocalization both contribute substantially to the redox potentials of 4Fe4S complexes, and Heisenberg coupling contributes to the difference in redox potential between 1Fe and 2Fe2S complexes, based on recent density functional calculations for model systems in solvents.},

We argue that many multireference dynamic correlation methods display unsatisfactory characteristics, including lack of size-consistency, a low-order treatment of correlation, and a poor computational scaling. By contrast, CT theory is based on an exponential ansatz that is rigorously size-consistent, reduces in a single-reference limit to a coupled cluster theory, and has an n 6 computational scaling with system and active space size. The efficient formulation of CT theory has allowed it to be applied to difficult systems in conjunction with active spaces with more than 30 orbitals, beyond the reach of traditional methods, with an accuracy that far exceeds multireference perturbation theories. Here we review the basic motivation, formulation, and implementation of CT theory, as well as survey some of our recent applications and possible future directions.},

It is now almost commonplace to publish an experimental paper together with quantum chemical calculations. The calculations serve either to validate the conclusions that have been reached from the analysis of the experiments or to distinguish between those possibilities that were left open. In addition, there are many purely theoretical investigations which address various structural and mechanistic aspects of metalloprotein structure and function. In this context the term ‘quantum chemical methods’ has been applied almost synonymously with density functional theory (DFT). Despite the enormous popularity of DFT in bioinorganic chemistry, one frequently voiced complaint from the experimental community is that the calculations often take too little or no notice of the available experimental results.

	abstract = {The accurate prediction of the potential energy function of the X1Σg+ state of Cr2 is a remarkable challenge; large differential electron correlation effects, significant scalar relativistic contributions, the need for large flexible basis sets containing g functions, the importance of semicore valence electron correlation, and its multireference nature pose considerable obstacles. So far, the only reasonable successful approaches were based on multireference perturbation theory (MRPT). Recently, there was some controversy in the literature about the role of error compensation and systematic defects of various MRPT implementations that cannot be easily overcome. A detailed basis set study of the potential energy function is presented, adopting a variational method. The method of choice for this electron-rich target with up to 28 correlated electrons is fully uncontracted multireference-averaged quadratic coupled cluster (MR-AQCC), which shares the flexibility of the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) approach and is, in addition, approximately size-extensive (0.02 eV in error as compared to the MRCI value of 1.37 eV for two noninteracting chromium atoms). The best estimate for De arrives at 1.48 eV and agrees well with the experimental data of 1.47 ± 0.056 eV. At the estimated CBS limit, the equilibrium bond distance (1.685 Å) and vibrational frequency (459 cm?1) are in agreement with experiment (1.679 Å, 481 cm?1). Large basis sets and reference configuration spaces invariably result in huge wave function expansions (here, up to 2.8 billion configuration state functions), and efficient parallel implementations of the method are crucial. Hence, relevant details on implementation and general performance of the parallel program code are discussed as well.},

The absorption spectrum of PPV consists of three peaks, while that of MEH-PPV has four peaks. We discuss the controversial origin of the extra peak as well as evidence for Davydov splitting effects in the absorption spectrum of PPV. The analysis of the nonlinear spectra shows further differences between the two materials. First, the binding energy of the 1Bu exciton for PPV is some 0.1 eV higher than for MEH-PPV. Second, the peak value of Im\{χ(3)(−ω;0,0,ω)\} for PPV is approximately 40 times higher than that of MEH-PPV. We also found that the sum-over-states modeling of the electroabsorption spectra indicates that the transition dipole moment between the mAg and nBu states is of opposite sign in the two polymers.},

The energy of the 11B−u exciton extrapolates to 2.60 eV in the limit of infinite polymers, while the energy of the 21A+g exciton extrapolates to 2.94 eV. The calculated binding energy of the 11B−u exciton is 0.9 eV for a 13 phenylene unit chain and 0.6 eV for an infinite polymer. This is expected to decrease due to solvation effects. The lowest triplet state is calculated to be at around 1.6 eV, with the triplet-triplet gap being around 1.6 eV. A comparison between theory and two-photon absorption and electroabsorption is made, leading to a consistent picture of the essential states responsible for most of the third-order nonlinear optical properties.

Formation of intracellular [Fe-S] clusters does not occur spontaneously but requires a complex biosynthetic machinery.

The general conclusion with respect to isomer shifts is that DFT (OLYP/STO-TZP) performs comparably well for iron nitrosyls and for iron complexes in general. However, quadrupole splittings are less accurately reproduced for nitrosyl complexes.},

	abstract = {Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: the entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such “area laws” for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium the current status of area laws in these fields is reviewed. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation in quantum lattice models, and disordered systems, nonequilibrium situations, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. These questions are considered in classical and quantum systems, in their ground and thermal states, for a variety of correlation measures. A significant proportion is devoted to the clear and quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. Matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogs, and variational sets from entanglement renormalization are also discussed and the paper is concluded by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations of quantum states.},

Using projection operators and second quantization algebra, an operator is constructed which consists of the complete active space Hamiltonian in the active space and the Mo/ller–Plesset zeroth‐order Hamiltonian in the inactive and secondary spaces. This operator, designated CAS/A, has the reference as an eigenfunction without the necessity of projection, it naturally incorporates denominator shifts which appear in terms of active space Fock operators, it does not give rise to intruder states, and it costs little more than other CASSCF perturbation theories. The incorporation of the complete active space Hamiltonian introduces additional active space two‐particle terms into the zeroth‐order energies over the Fock operators, which may be regarded as an inconsistency. To achieve an approximate consistency, they may be removed or supplemented with other particle–particle and hole–hole terms. The results of test calculations indicate that supplementation is not advisable and that removal has only a modest effect. The test calculations are compared with other results and experiment, and support the effectiveness of the proposed CAS/A Ĥ0.},

The renormalization group algorithm is then interpreted in terms of familiar quantum chemical concepts, and its numerical behavior, including its convergence and computational cost, are studied using both model and real systems. The asymptotic convergence of the algorithm is derived. Finally, we examine the performance of the DMRG on widely studied chemical problems, such as the water molecule, the twisting barrier of ethene, and the dissociation of nitrogen. In all cases, the results compare favorably with the best existing quantum chemical methods, and particularly so when the nondynamical correlation is strong.

This enzyme is capable of inserting a double bond into an alkyl chain by double hydrogen (H) atom abstraction using molecular O2. The reaction step studied here is presumably associated with the highest activation barrier along the full pathway; therefore, its quantitative assessment is of key importance to the understanding of the catalysis. The DMRG approach allows unprecedentedly large active spaces for the explicit correlation of electrons in the large part of the chemically important valence space, which is apparently conditio sine qua non for obtaining well-converged reaction energetics. The derived reaction mechanism involves protonation of the previously characterized 1,2-? peroxy FeIIIFeIII (P) intermediate to a 1,1-? hydroperoxy species, which abstracts an H atom from the C10 site of the substrate. An FeIV-oxo unit is generated concomitantly, supposedly capable of the second H atom abstraction from C9. In addition, several popular DFT functionals were compared to the computed DMRG-CASPT2 data. Notably, many of these show a preference for heterolytic C?H cleavage, erroneously predicting substrate hydroxylation. This study shows that, despite its limitations, DMRG-CASPT2 is a significant methodological advancement toward the accurate computational treatment of complex bioinorganic systems, such as those with the highly open-shell diiron active sites.},

In addition, a new hybrid method denoted CIPT2, in which excitations solely from the active space are treated by MRCI and the remaining ones by perturbation theory, is proposed and applied. These methods are used to analyse valence and core correlation effects on the potential energy function. MRCI calculations which fully include correlation of the 3p, 3d, and 4s electrons yield excellent agreement with experimental values for the equilibrium distance Re and the harmonic vibrational constant ω e . Correlation of the (3p) orbitals is found to be very important. At the MRCI+Q level this reduces Re by 0.08 Å and increases ω e by about 200 cm−1. These effects are not correctly reproduced in CASPT2 and CIPT2. It is shown that in CASPT2 the valence correlation effects are significantly overestimated and the distance dependence of the core correlation is incorrect. The basis set limit of the dissociation energies for MRCI+Q and CASPT 2 is estimated to be 1.3 eV and 1.9 eV, respectively. The remaining error (≈ 0.2 − 0.3 eV) of the MRCI+Q dissociation energy is attributed to unlinked cluster and higher excitation effects, which are only approximately accounted for by the Davidson correction.},

The results confirm the known assignment of two energies, the 2 1A− g adiabatic excitation energy and the 2 1A− g vertical emission energy, for which well defined experimental values are available, with an excellent agreement between theory and experiment. In the experimental absorptionspectrum, the maximum of the band describing the 1 1B+ u ← 1 1 A g − excitation is the first peak and it has been assigned to the (0-0) vibrational transition, but in literature it is normally compared with the theoretical vertical excitation energy. This comparison has been questioned in the past, but a conclusive demonstration of its lack of foundation has not been given. The analysis reported here, while confirming the assignment of the highest peak in the experimental spectrum to the (0-0) adiabatic transition, indicates that it cannot be used as a reference for the vertical excitation energy. The theoretical vertical excitation energies for the 2 1A− g and 1 1B+ u states are found to be almost degenerate, with a value, ≃ 4.8 eV, higher than that normally accepted in the literature, 4.4 eV. The motivations which have induced in the past other authors to consider this a correct value are discussed and the origin of their feebleness are analyzed.},

A review of the NEVPT approach is presented, starting from the original second order state-specific formulation, going through the quasidegenerate multi-state extension and arriving at the recent implementations of the third order in the energy and of the internally contracted configuration interaction.

The new formulation is based on the introduction of average values in the unperturbed state of excitation operators which bear resemblance with analogous ones occurring in the extended Koopmans’ theorem and in the equations-of-motion technique. Such auxiliary quantities, which allow the second-order perturbation contribution to the energy to be evaluated very efficiently, can be calculated at the outset provided the unperturbed four-particle spinless density matrix in the active orbital space is available. A noticeable inequality concerning second-order energy contributions of the same type between the strongly and partially contracted versions is proven to hold. An example concerning the successful calculation of the potential energy curve for the Cr 2 molecule is discussed.},

They differ by the degree of contraction of the outer-space perturbers. Two types of zero-order Hamiltonians are proposed, both are bielectronic, incorporating the interactions between electrons in the active orbitals, therefore introducing a rational balance between the zero-order wave function and the outer-space. The use of Dyall’s Hamiltonian, which puts the active electrons in a fixed core field, and of a partially contracted formalism seems a promising compromise. The formalism is generalizable to multireference spaces which are parts of a CAS. A few test applications of the simplest variant developed in this paper illustrate its potentialities.},

	abstract = {The d8s2(3F), d9s(3D), d9s(1D), and d10(1S) states of the nickel atom have been studied using the complete active space (CAS) SCF method and a second order perturbation approach (CASPT2), which applies the CASSCF wavefunction as reference. A large basis set of the atomic natural orbital type was used. Three different active spaces were employed: (3d, 4s), (3d, 4s, 4p), and (3d, 4s, 4p, 3d′). The largest CASPT2 calculations correlated 18 electrons in 14 orbitals. These calculations yield the following excitation energies with respect to the 3D (d9s) ground state (relativistic corrections are included): 3F: −0.08 eV; 1D: 0.32 eV; 1S: 1.77 eV. The corresponding experimental excitation energies are (averaged over the j manifold): 0.03 (3F), 0.33 (1D), and 1.74 eV (1S), respectively. The following results are obtained when only the ten valence electrons are correlated: 3F: −0.19 eV; 1D: 0.30 eV; 1S: 1.90 eV and the results at the CASSCF level are: 3F: −0.76 eV; 1D: 0.32 eV; 1S: 2.17 eV.},

	abstract = {Electrospray ionization (ESI) has become an essential tool in chemical physics and physical chemistry for the production of novel molecular ions from solution samples for a variety of spectroscopic experiments. ESI was used to produce free multiply-charged anions (MCAs) for photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) in the late 1990 s, allowing many interesting properties of this class of exotic species to be investigated. Free MCAs are characterized by strong intramolecular Coulomb repulsions, which create a repulsive Coulomb barrier (RCB) for electron emission. The RCB endows many fascinating properties to MCAs, giving rise to meta-stable anions with negative electron binding energies. Recent development in the PES of MCAs includes photoelectron imaging to examine the influence of the RCB on the electron emission dynamics, pump-probe experiments to examine electron tunneling through the RCB, and isomer-specific experiments by coupling PES with ion mobility for biological MCAs. The development of a cryogenically cooled Paul trap has led to much better resolved PE spectra for MCAs by creating vibrationally cold anions from the room temperature ESI source. Recent advances in coupling the cryogenic Paul trap with PE imaging have allowed high-resolution PE spectra to be obtained for singly charged anions produced by ESI. In particular, the observation of dipole-bound excited states has made it possible to conduct vibrational autodetachment spectroscopy and resonant PES, which yield much richer vibrational spectroscopic information for dipolar free radicals than traditional PES.},
