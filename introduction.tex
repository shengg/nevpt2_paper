\section{Introduction}

In many quantum chemistry applications, such as to excited states, non-equilibrium geometries,
and transition-metal chemistry, the mean-field description of electron interactions is insufficient. 
The deviation from mean-field behaviour of the electrons, i.e. electron correlation, is usually classified
into two types: static or non-dynamic correlation, and dynamic correlation.
Conventionally, static correlation is the correlation between near-degenerate valence orbitals, and can be treated by
considering the set of possible configurations of electrons in the set of active valence orbitals.
If all such configurations are included and the orbitals are simultaneously optimized, one arrives at the complete active space
self-consistent-field (CASSCF) model, the most widely used method to describe static correlation.
Dynamic correlation is the correlation between valence orbitals and the remaining empty (virtual) or doubly occupied (core) states.
This effect is thought of
as captured by low particle-rank excitations, such as used in
perturbation theories (PT), configuration interaction singles  and doubles  (CISD), or coupled cluster theory (CC).
The combined treatment of static and dynamic correlation is the domain of multireference correlation theories, such as
multi-reference perturbation theories (MRPT)\cite{andersson_second-order_1990}, multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI)\cite{buenker_individualized_1974} or multi-reference coupled cluster theories (MRCC) \cite{oliphant_multireference_1991}.

%% In CASSCF and MR methods (MRPT, MRCI and MRCC) based on CASSCF wave functions, static correlation within the active orbitals is solved exactly through the full configuration interaction (FCI). The exponential increasing of computations of FCI limits the number of active orbitals. 
The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) \cite{white_density_1992,white_density-matrix_1993, ostlund_thermodynamic_1995, rommer_class_1997, schollwock_density-matrix_2005, schollwock_density-matrix_2011} has made it possible to employ  large active spaces 
to describe static correlation\cite{white_ab_1999, chan_highly_2002, legeza_controlling_2003,moritz_decomposition_2007, verstraete_matrix_2008, marti_density_2008, zgid_spin_2008, marti_density_2010, kurashige_high-performance_2009, luo_optimizing_2010, chan_density_2011, marti_new_2011, sharma_spin-adapted_2012, wouters_longitudinal_2012, wouters_thouless_2013, kurashige_entangled_2013, wouters_communication:_2014} and it has become straightforward to
use the DMRG as a robust numerical solver in a variety of frontier applications, including benchmark solutions of small molecules\cite{chan_highly_2002,legeza_controlling_2003,luo_optimizing_2010, olivares-amaya_ab-initio_2015}, multi-center transition metal clusters\cite{kurashige_high-performance_2009,marti_new_2011, kurashige_entangled_2013, sharma_low-energy_2014}, as well as to molecular crystals\cite{yang_ab_2014}. There have been several
efforts to further include dynamic correlation on top of the DMRG reference.
For example, DMRG-CT~\cite{neuscamman_review_2010}, DMRG-CASPT2 ~\cite{kurashige_second-order_2011}, DMRG-cu(4)-MRCI ~\cite{saitow_fully_2015} (in an internally contracted (IC) formulation) and MPS-PT~\cite{sharma_communication:_2014} and MPS-LCC ~\cite{sharma_multireference_2015} (in an uncontracted
formulation) 
are all attempts in this direction. There have also been efforts to combine DMRG with DFT~\cite{reiher_density_2015}.
%On the other hand, dynamic electron correlation is crucial in chemical dynamic processes, which in general involves electron correlation dynamics within a large range of orbitals. 
%% The DMRG method has been embedded with the second-order perturbation theory
%% complete active space perturbation theory (CASPT), and canonical transformation(CT)\cite{neuscamman_review_2010}, etc., to be extended for dynamic correlation. 
In the internally contracted multireference methods, high order reduced density matrices (RDM) of the DMRG active space wavefunction are required.
Such density matrices, although simple in a theoretical sense, are computationally non-trivial to obtain.

In this work, we have developed a general algorithm to efficiently compute high order reduced density matrices from DMRG wave functions. 
Using these RDM calculations, we may then implement a variety of methods to treat electron correlation external to the DMRG active space.
As an example of this, we have implemented the strongly contracted variant of second order $N$-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2) 
\cite{angeli_introduction_2001,angeli_n-electron_2001, angeli_n-electron_2002}, an intruder-state-free multireference perturbation theory, on top
of the DMRG reference wavefunction, to yield a method we call DMRG-SC-NEVPT2.
To demonstrate the potential of this approach, we apply the method to study the potential energy curve of the chromium dimer, and 
to compute the excitation energies of the quasi-one dimensional conjugated poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV). 
The chromium dimer is a particularly demanding small molecule that has been widely studied with many techniques\cite{roos_ground_2003,celani_cipt2_2004,angeli_third-order_2006,muller_large-scale_2009,kurashige_second-order_2011,ruiperez_complete_2011,kurashige_multireference_2014,sharma_multireference_2015}, and thus forms a good test bed to demonstrate the performance of DMRG-SC-NEVPT2. Using an active space with 22 orbitals and basis sets extrapolated to the CBS limit, we show that we can
compute both the spectroscopic constants and the full curve,
with an accuracy that compares quite favourably to earlier calculations.
PPV on the other hand, is of interest as a prototypical light-emitting polymer\cite{burroughes_light-emitting_1990,friend_electroluminescence_1999}.
Light emission relies
on the correct ordering of the first optically bright $1^{1}B_{u}$ state
and  dark $2^{1}A_{g}$ state, and describing this ordering requires an appropriate
treatment of electron correlation~\cite{beljonne_theoretical_1995,lavrentiev_theoretical_1999,shukla_correlated_2002, han_time-dependent_2004, saha_investigation_2007, bursill_symmetry-adapted_2009}.
%% The first  whose polaronic feature is suggested to be 
%% responsible for the charge-transfer behavior, is estimated to lie below the  with a small gap of 0.7eV\cite{martin_linear_1999}. 
%% While many theoretical studies of PPV have used model Hamiltonians, such as the  Pariser\textendash Parr\textendash Pople (PPP) model, \cite{shukla_correlated_2002, bursill_symmetry-adapted_2009} or other semi-empirical  methods \cite{beljonne_theoretical_1995} due to the large system size, 
With DMRG-SC-NEVPT2, we show that we can compute the excitation 
energies and energy ordering of the different states accurately, starting 
from the full-valence active $\pi$ space of the molecule.
